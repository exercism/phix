Solution        Incorrect Forth input                   Expected output     Current output      Comment

On top of my head I recall the following missing correctness:

It is possible to have multiple instructions on 1 line
It is possible to re-define operators, the following program will have the stack [0]:
: + - ; 1 1 +
